        <p>
          I'm a Senior at USF majoring in Cybersecurity with a graduation date set to be in the Fall of 2023.
          I started wanting to get into Cybersecurity/IT when I was younger, I was always the kid who helped his grandparents set up technologies
          and would be the "call man" for when they needed me to come over. When in high school, I was allowed to tour USF and was amazed with the concept of Cybersecurity.
          From there on out, I have decided that this major was going to be what I wanted to do in life. I have spent the last few years leading up to
          graduation falling in love with the space of Cybersecurity and having the pleasure to be able to work on
          labs/projects relating to <span>PenTesting, Risk Analysis, Cloud Technologies, Red/Blue Team, Threat Assessment, and DevOps</span>.
          Moving forward, I am working towards opportunities to learn and cultivate my skills in the hope that I can use them in the field that I fell in love with.
